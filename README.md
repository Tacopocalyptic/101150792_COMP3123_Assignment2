within the docker-compose file are commands to containerize this project.

### Backend
API for user sign-up/login and employee management system built with/using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.

Currently, the login system returns a JWT but it is never used for authentication. 

### Frontend
Created with React.

Login or Registration are required to access the employee management pages.
The JWT held in localStorage is not properly used for authenticating, as this is still in dev.
If desired, assign any value to 'jwt' to access the employee management pages.
